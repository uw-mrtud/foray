## Old setup instructions 

To run from source, make a virtual environment in `nodes/`, `python -m .venv` activate it, and `pip install .`
Edit `.cargo.config.toml` and set PYO3_PYTHON to the absolute path of the virtual environment just created. (This will not be necessary in the future)

then run with `cargo run`
