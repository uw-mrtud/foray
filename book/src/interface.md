# The Interface
## Network

On the right is your network.


Controls: 
- `click and drag` on an empty area moves the network around
    - on a laptop `touchpad scroll` (two fingers) works very nicely
- `click and drag` on a node moves the node
- `click and drag` on a port to connect nodes
- `right click` on a port to remove a connection
    - connections can also be replaced if a new connection is added on top of an existing connection
- `cmd + a` create new node
- `shift + click` select multiple nodes


## Application Actions
In the top left:
- Create a new network
- Load a network
- Save current network

- Undo
- Redo
